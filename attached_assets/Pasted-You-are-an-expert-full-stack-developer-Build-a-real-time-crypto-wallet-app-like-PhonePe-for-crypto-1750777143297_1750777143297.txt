You are an expert full-stack developer. Build a real-time crypto wallet app (like PhonePe for crypto). The app must be simple, minimal, mobile-friendly, and user-friendly. Here's exactly what the app must do:--- FEATURES TO IMPLEMENT ---User AuthenticationAllow user registration (email & password).On successful registration, generate a new crypto wallet  and store the wallet address & private key securely in the database (NEVER expose the private key on frontend).Allow login with credentials to access the app.Wallet FunctionsReceive Crypto:Let user select a crypto trx, usdt ...Display their wallet address and a QR scanner to share/receive funds.Send Crypto:Let user select crypto to send, enter recipient wallet address, and enter amount.Before sending, check if they have enough funds.If not enough balance, show a clear error: “Insufficient funds.”Show estimated gas/transaction fees.Confirm and process the transaction using web3.js or ethers.js or respective SDKs.Store transaction records in a database.DashboardOn home, show total asset value Below that, show each coin:Symbol: ETH, USDT, BTCBalance: 0.3 ETH, 10 USDT, etc.Value in INR/USD: e.g., ₹45,000% Change in last 24 hours (API: CoinGecko or similar).Show all transaction history (sent, received, with timestamps and status).Error HandlingEvery action must show proper success/failure messages.For example:“Wallet created successfully.”“Invalid wallet address.”“Insufficient funds to complete transaction.”“Transaction sent successfully.”“Server error: Try again later.”Tech Stack Recommendation (you can modify if needed):Backend: Node.js + ExpressFrontend: HTML/CSS/JS (or optionally React)Wallet: ethers.js or web3.jsCrypto Prices: CoinGecko API (free)QR Generator: Any JS QR librarydatabase to store all detailsSecurity InstructionsStore private keys encrypted (never show in frontend).Do not allow duplicate wallet creation on re-registration.Avoid any on-chain writes unless sending coins.Validate all inputs (amounts, addresses, etc.).--- END OF INSTRUCTIONS ---Please now generate the complete code with backend and frontend, no placeholder logic or unhandled parts. Fix errors during build and don’t skip any steps. Always validate data. Ensure everything works in real-time.another prompt for reference: "i am trying to build a new project its like phone pay for crypto just simply receive/hold/send crypto when ever user wantit may look like an new user can register in our app on their succesfull registration we will create a wallet for him in our app where he can now send recive crypto into this walletnow after successful registering he should login with his credentialsnow he has access to the full app he can click on receive and select what crypto to recive then it will show the respective wallet address and scanner to receive money from othershe can also send the crypto to others select crypto coin to send fill address where to send how much to send if enough crypto is peresent in his wallet the transaction will be succesfull also show gas feeshe can check all the transaction details in historyevery thing must be simple for user no complex things included on home page we may show all his assets like trx:20 into usdt: $1800 approx, btc: 0.5 worth:$50000 etc... on home but above all we will show total value of assets and also percantage incresed or decreased in past 24 hours like a real walleti want to complete this project cause you know everything is now developing so i know in future everyone will use crypto for simple transactions so i wanna create a platform for them which must be simple no complexity for user "
